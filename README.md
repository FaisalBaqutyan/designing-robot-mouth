# designing-robot-mouth

I designed a robot mouth that moves while the robot talks using the principle of bevel gear to convert the rotation's direction. this idea came to my mind from one of my previous projects, in which I designed an electromechanical scissor lift and it worked perfectly.  I will explain the robot mouth mechanism at the end

## working principle 

first, there will be a small motor inside the face which is connected with a small shaft and at the end of the shaft there will be a bevel gear to change the direction of the rotation. the second bevel gear will be connected at the top of the robot face shaft 

the final robot face will look like

if the motor rotates a little bit the robot will look like

and if the motor again rotates a little bit in the opposite direction, the robot will go back to its initial position, this is how we can make the robot move its mouth while it talks. we can give a command to the motor to do this operation while the robot talks by using a sound sensor inside the face 


I can make sure that the robot's mouth will not rotate and it will only go up and down since it has its own path
